# TableTopSimDeckCrator
This application is designed to make creating Magic The Gathering decks easier in Tabletop Simulator.

This is a fun and educational project, I do not have the rights to images (card scans) or text from Magic the Gathering. If you use this application to create decks and upload them online you are responsible for ensuring it does not infrange on anyone else's copyright.

The code and functionality is my own, you can modify and redestribute it for non-comercial purpuses free of charge as long as you credit me and link to the original GitHub project and include this README file.
